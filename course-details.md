This course is about continuous delivery, or CD, with GitHub Actions. CD is a crucial part of modern software development, and it can have a monumental impact on development projects. 

Continuous Delivery is the practice of delivering software faster and with higher quality. Doing so successfully requires many different practices, behaviors, and technologies. 

In this course, we focus on using workflows to deploy pull requests automatically to a staging environment, and to deploy all merged commits to production. We will create two workflows to deploy our app to an AWS S3 bucket automatically.


## What you'll learn

We'll answer common questions like:
- What is Continuous Delivery?
- What is a workflow file and how are workflows used with GitHub Actions?
- What are deployment triggers and how are they used with deployments?
- How can secrets store tokens?


And when you're done you'll be able to:
- Use GitHub Actions and create workflow files
- Configure AWS S3 for deployment
- Use secrets to store tokens
- Deploy to staging and production


## What you'll build
In this course, we'll be walking through a CD deployment using GitHub Actions, following steps such as adding conditional triggers:
